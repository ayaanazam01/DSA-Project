The Student Helper Program is a console application providing students with tools across three key academic and personal areas. Its Budget Manager module helps students control finances by allowing them to set a total budget, allocate funds to prioritized categories using custom or preset distributions, and break down budgets into daily or weekly divisions. The Plagiarism Detector module promotes academic integrity by comparing two text documents (source and target) to identify similarities based on n-grams and a similarity threshold, calculating a plagiarism percentage and generating detailed reports of matching sections. Finally, the Time Manager module assists with organization by functioning as a task scheduler, enabling students to add tasks with priorities and deadlines, define dependencies between tasks, and generate a valid execution order. The program provides a centralized command-line interface to access these features.
